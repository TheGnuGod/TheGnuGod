Hi! I'm ðŸ¦¬GnuðŸ¦¬* (da boo dee da boo doo).

I coded in C# for a long time, but then switched to C, becuase I felt like it. I've always felt like a wanted to code as much as possible myself, and not have to watch tutorials or read loads of documentation to understand what someone else made, and C gave me that feeling. I used to sometimes toy around with Unity, but that felt like there was way more to memorise than actually learn.
I now primarily code in Swift, a wonderful, high-level programming language with beautiful syntax. Coding in swift sometimes just makes you feel all those that made this language (which you can contribute to on GitHub!) just are so damn smart.

But I ramble.

I have no social media accounts, on Threads, Mastodon, **X** or otherwise, so that's why there's no links to any.
I've never really used GitHub much, but I'm learning as I write this and think that open source is just wonderful.
Right now macOS is my OS of choice, but that also comes from the amazing hardware Apple makes, and how good Xcode is. When editing in the termianl I use vim, and will never, ever use an editor that doesn't let me use the best set of keyboard shortcuts ever designed.

I hope this wasn't a waste of your time, and that you use the word "tetrice". ðŸ‘‹
