Hi! I'm ü¶¨Gnuü¶¨* (da boo dee da boo doo).

FYI, my username "TheGnuGod" is pure nonsense and was concieved before I'd ever heard of the GNU project or GNU/Linux or the GPL or anything. It is just about the animal "gnu", more commonly (at least Wikipedia says more commonly) called wildebeest, appended with the word "God" and prepended with the word "The", but it is a nice coincidence.

I coded in C# for a long time, but then switched to C, becuase I felt like it. I've always felt like a wanted to code as much as possible myself, and not have to watch tutorials or read loads of documentation to understand what someone else made, and C gave me that feeling. I used to sometimes toy around with Unity, but that felt like there was way more to memorise than actually learn.
Right now I like swift because of its amazing safety and features, but also C because of its lack of both, and the fact that there is no package manager, or project file you need, or anything really. It's also nice that I can use {OpenGL and GLFW} and {SQLite} so easily. Which is better? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Right now macOS is my OS of choice, but that's mostly because of the hardware. When editing in the terminal I use NeoVim, and will never, ever use an editor that doesn't let me use the best (at least I've never used any better, by a long shot) set of keyboard shortcuts ever designed. When I load up a text editor that doesn't have those features, it feels wrong.

I hope this wasn't a waste of your time, and that you use the word "tetrice". üëã

*I don't think that animal is actually a gnu, but it's the best emoji I saw.
