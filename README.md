Hi! I'm ðŸ¦¬GnuðŸ¦¬* (da boo dee da boo doo).

Just to make this clear, my username "TheGnuGod" is pure nonsense and was concieved before I'd ever heard of the GNU project or GNU/Linux or the GPL or anything. It is just about the animal "gnu", more commonly (at least Wikipedia says more commonly) called wildebeest, appended with the world "God" and prepended the with word "The", but it is a nice coincidence. Now for the rest of the README.

I coded in C# for a long time, but then switched to C, becuase I felt like it. I've always felt like a wanted to code as much as possible myself, and not have to watch tutorials or read loads of documentation to understand what someone else made, and C gave me that feeling. I used to sometimes toy around with Unity, but that felt like there was way more to memorise than actually learn.
I now primarily code in Swift, a wonderful, high-level programming language with beautiful syntax. Coding in swift gives you access to safe, understandable APIs with great documentation, all made in the open source by smart people. Even though swift is most famously used to build apps for Apple platforms, it is cross-platform on Windwos and many Linux distros as well. You can find out more at [swift.org](https://www.swift.org).

But I ramble.

I have no social media accounts on Threads, Mastodon, **X** or otherwise, so that's why there's no links to any.
I've never really used GitHub much, but I'm learning more and more about how to use Git and really like the idea of Open Source.
Right now macOS is my OS of choice, but that also comes from the amazing hardware Apple makes, and how good Xcode is. When editing in the terminal I use Vim, and will never, ever use an editor that doesn't let me use the best set of keyboard shortcuts ever designed.

I hope this wasn't a waste of your time, and that you use the word "tetrice". ðŸ‘‹

*I don't think that animal is actually a gnu, but it's the best emoji I saw.
